# Ultima Online - Imperial UO

Ultima Online is a multiplayer online role-playing game released in 1997.\
After the game was released, dedicated server emulators were created so people could host servers (shards) instead of playing in the original server.

In 1999 a server called MPZ was created by 2 Portuguese friends and an incredible community with thousands of players came along.\
In circa 2002 the server changed owners and name. It was now called Burstfire UO.\
It changed owners at least 2 more times.

In 2016 I decided to continue the legacy.\
I named it **Imperial UO**.\
I've made many changes to the game, from scripts, to design, map, art, mechanics. I added more than 30 thousand lines of code.

With the help of friends, research and persistance I made a fully working server and website.\
Previously I didn't know how to script or anything game / web related.\
I opened the server in 2016 and then again in 2020.\
Gathered more than 1000+ unique players from all over the world mostly being from Europe.\
Players online at any time of the day and some not even logging out for days.

I've uploaded the scripts, that have been circulating from 1999, and my added scripts that I used in the game.\
I'm not sharing any more files besides the scripts because the server had logs from real people, account details and private conversations. Which are confidential.

Server wasn't completely done by myself, I had only the idea to continue the shard, but I lacked the skills in scripting and other needed areas.\
I learned how to do most stuff, but things I couldn't do I had a team of people helping me.\
Pink Panther, Ray, Ribeiro, Kenzo, Spitfire, TK, Lil Eddie, Wigifer, and a few others.

Fun times.\
Will open again one day.
